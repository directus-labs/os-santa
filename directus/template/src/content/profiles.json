I've been watching you, Bryant, and let me tell you, your GitHub profile is about as impressive as a melted snowman.\n\nYou've got a whopping 15 repositories to your name. Wow! I'm sure the open source community is just trembling with excitement over your groundbreaking \"test-template\" project. And don't even get me started on your fork of the Jamstack repo. I'm sure your contributions there were absolutely crucial to the future of web development.\n\nI see you're wishing for \"More time to build cool stuff.\" Here's a novel idea - maybe spend less time mindlessly clicking the \"Star\" button on other people's work (507 times, really?) and more time actually coding. Just a thought!\n\nP.S. Next time you decide to fork a project, try adding some actual commits. Your copy-paste skills are truly unparalleled.\n",

Well, consider this letter your Christmas miracle – I'm actually acknowledging your existence.\n\nP.S.
